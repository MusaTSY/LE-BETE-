## Description

In collaboration with my college classmates, we embarked on a project to create a clothing store that not only served as a platform to demonstrate our proficiency in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript but also seamlessly integrated web development elements into Node.js. Our objective was to host the website on a local machine, prioritizing accessibility and reliability.

Throughout the project, we prioritized interactivity with the end user, employing visually appealing UI designs that I personally crafted **Homepage and Access Bar Across Webpage**. The aim was to enhance engagement and provide a user-friendly experience.
